# Spam-Filtering

A spam filter is a program that is used to detect unsolicited and unwanted email and prevent those messages from getting to a user's inbox. And it is implemented using [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) and [Naive Bayes classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).
